# Cohor
## Local Development Setup with Ngrok

This project requires Ngrok to be installed and configured for local development. Follow the steps below to set up and test the application locally.

### Prerequisites
1. Download and install [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com/).
2. Create a free Ngrok account and log in.
3. Follow the instructions on the Ngrok website to set up and authenticate Ngrok on your local machine.

### Steps to Configure

#### 1. Create a Tunnel for the Backend
Run the following command to create a tunnel for the backend:
```bash
ngrok http <backend-port>
```
Replace `<backend-port>` with the port your backend is running on (e.g., 3000).

#### 2. Update Environment Variables

##### Frontend
1. Open the `.env` file in your frontend project.
2. Add or update the `API_URL` variable with the URL generated by Ngrok for your backend. For example:
   ```
   API_URL=https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io
   ```

##### Backend
1. Open the `.env` file in your backend project.
2. Add or update the `COHOR_API_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT_URI` variable with the URL generated by Ngrok for your backend. For example:
   ```
   COHOR_API_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT_URI=https://<your-ngrok-subdomain>.ngrok.io
   ```

#### 3. Restart Your Applications
After updating the environment variables, restart both the backend and frontend applications to apply the changes.

### Notes
- Ensure that Ngrok is running while testing locally to keep the tunnel active.
- The Ngrok URL changes every time you restart the tunnel unless you have a paid account with a reserved domain.

### Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues:
1. Verify that Ngrok is running and generating the correct URL.
2. Ensure the `.env` files are updated correctly and saved.
3. Restart your applications to reload the updated configurations.

With these steps completed, you should be able to test the application locally using Ngrok.
